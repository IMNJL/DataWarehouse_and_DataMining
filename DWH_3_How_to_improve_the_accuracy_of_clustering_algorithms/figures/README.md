Figures README

This folder is intended to contain experiment figures referenced by `DWH_3_HIAC_experiment_report.md`.

- Place the original PCA scatter image (provided as chat attachment) here and name it `original.png` so it will appear in the report:

  `figures/original.png`

- Optional additional images produced by `HIAC.py` to add here:
  - `decision_<k>_<threshold>.png` (decision graph saved by the script)
  - `<dataset>_original.png` (original PCA image if produced by the run)
  - `<dataset>_ameliorated_by_HIAC.png` (PCA image after amelioration)

If you'd like, I can copy the chat attachment into `figures/original.png` for you — confirm and I'll save it in place.
